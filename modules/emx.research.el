;; Witnesses unto them.
;;
;; I intend to use Emacs as a key tool to manage study notes, research notes,
;; references and related tasks such as organisation.
;;
;; I don't intend on restricting myself to tools that already exist. I might
;; assimilate packages into this Emacs distribution.
;;
;; Reference management, archiving research papers, manuscripts, books, etc.
;;
;; Triggers:
;;
;; 1. Philosophical, theological research
;; 2. Islamic studies, study of Quran, Arabic Grammer, Linguistics
;; 3. Politics, world human history, natural history
;; 4. Natural sciences, geometric sciences
;; 5. Mathematical sciences, algebraic sciences
;;
;; Writing:
;;
;; 1. Quick capture notes
;; 2. Curated notes, with structure, and integrated into a coherent framework
;; 3. Logical provenance (DAG) of conceptual/logical/argument frameworks
;; 4. Short-form writing (essays) about a topic
;; 5. Long-form writing (articles, large essays, book length etc)
;; 6. Study notes for a topic
;;
;; General life
;; 1. Personal notes about people I interact with in my life
;;
;; Reference management
;; 1. Drag and drop addition of references, PDFs, DOIs, etc, and organic
;;    curation of reference listings.

;;; Note-taking and personal knowledge management
;;
;; A number of packages has been developed to help manage a "knowledge base"
;; using Emacs. Some of these have good integration with reference management as
;; well.
;;
;; The options that I want to explore are:
;;
;;   1. howm
;;   2. zk
;;   3. denote
;;
;; There are others such org-roam, deft, zettledeft. However, from a cursory
;; look at them, I have decided against trying them for now.

;;; Code:

;;; Note-taking

;; howm - A note-taking framework that encourages organic note taking

  :init
  ;; Where to store the files?
  (setq howm-directory "~/work/howm")
  (setq howm-home-directory howm-directory)
  ;; What format to use for the files?
  (setq howm-file-name-format "%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S.org")
  (setq howm-view-title-header "*")
  (setq howm-dtime-format "<%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M>")
  ;; Avoid conflicts with Org-mode by changing Howm's prefix from "C-c ,".
  (setq howm-prefix (kbd "C-c ;"))
  :bind*
  ;; Conveniently open the Howm menu with "C-c ; ;".
  ("C-c ; ;" . howm-menu))

;; zk - simple zettlekasten implementation
