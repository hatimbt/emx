# Journal Entry: 2025-04-20

## Session Summary
- Discovered the new `.ai-assistant` directory structure
- Reviewed Decision Records relocated from `docs/decisions/` to `.ai-assistant/decisions/`
- Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect the new documentation structure
- Created initial notes on project structure
- Developed package management strategy with clear division between Nix and Elpaca
- Updated home-module.nix to implement the package strategy in Nix
- Moved TODO.org to the `.ai-assistant` directory for tracking

## Project Understanding
The project is an Emacs configuration system with a hybrid approach:
- Uses Nix for managing the Emacs binary, system dependencies, and stable core packages
- Uses Elpaca for managing dynamic Elisp packages that need customization or frequent updates
- Follows a modular design with clear separation between Nix and Elisp components
- Organized around specialized modules (programming, research, navigation, etc.)
- Focuses on achieving both reproducibility and flexibility

## Implementation Progress
- Added structured list of core packages to be managed by Nix in home-module.nix
- Created comprehensive documentation of the package management strategy
- Distinguished between packages suitable for Nix vs. Elpaca management

## Next Steps
- Continue refining the Nix configuration
- Review the individual Emacs modules to identify any potential package conflicts
- Ensure proper bootstrapping between Nix-managed and Elpaca-managed packages
- Consider additional tools for Lisp programming, reference management, and other user priorities
