# Journal Entry: 2025-04-21

## Today's Work
- Implemented XDG-compliant directory structure using Hybrid Approach with Fallbacks
- Created decision record analyzing alternatives for XDG compliance
- Updated home-module.nix with emx launcher and configuration shims
- Modified early-init.el and init.el with fallback directory detection
- Configured Elpaca to use proper XDG data directories
- Documented edge cases and execution flow

## Latest Implementation
- Added flag-based development mode (`emx --dev`) with clear interface
- Created decision record analyzing flag-based vs. dual binary approach
- Implemented launcher script that detects the `--dev` flag
- Updated shims to use environment variable for mode detection
- Preserved shared configuration directory for state files
- Added error handling for missing localPath configuration

## Key Features
- Works in both launcher script and direct evaluation contexts
- Preserves development workflow with localPath
- Properly separates config, data, and cache directories
- Single command with explicit development mode flag
- Consistent directory variable access across all files
- Graceful fallbacks for development and testing scenarios

## Next Steps
- Test the implementation in both default and development modes
- Configure additional tools (like no-littering) to use XDG paths
- Document launcher usage in user documentation
