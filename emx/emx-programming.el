;; Software development
;;
;; Emacs is probably the best available editor for writing Lisp programs. Emacs
;; doesn't fair well for multithreading tasks. In this configuration, we setup
;; tools that aid software development, and related tasks such as version
;; control. I do not aim to have Emacs be the only programming IDE that I use, I
;; am exploring Neovim/Helix for languages for which support is lacking in
;; Emacs.

;; Recently there has been a plethora of alternatives that has been published.

;; Scheme REPL interagration
;;
;; * Alternatives:
;;
;; 1. Andrew Tropin has an alternative based on nREPL (used in Clojure land).
;;    Arei is the Emacs client, and guile-ares-rs is the the Repl Server. This
;;    needs to be run in the background. He considers Geiser to have some
;;    limitations, and chose to implement a new REPL integration. He claims to
;;    have tried to contribute to Geiser but that he found it difficult.
