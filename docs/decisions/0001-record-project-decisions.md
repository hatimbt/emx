# 1. Record Project Decisions

Date: 2025-04-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the decisions made on this project to provide context for future development and to help AI assistants better understand the reasoning behind our choices.

I'm experimenting with an AI-assisted workflow for this project, and these Decision Records (DRs) serve multiple purposes:
1. They help me (the human developer) remember and revisit decisions
2. They provide AI assistants with context for understanding past decisions when I return to the project
3. They document the thought process for potential future contributors
4. They serve as an experiment in human-AI collaborative documentation

## Decision

We will use Decision Records (DRs) in a lightweight format:

1. Stored in `docs/decisions/` 
2. Using markdown files with a simple consistent structure
3. Numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
4. Containing sections for context, decision, alternatives considered, and consequences
5. Treated as living documents that can be updated as needed

## Consequences

1. Both humans and AI assistants will have easier access to the context and reasoning behind decisions
2. We avoid overly formal documentation while still capturing critical design information
3. The history of our thinking will be preserved in the project repository
4. New contributors can quickly understand why things are designed as they are
5. The project will benefit from continuity even with breaks between development sessions
